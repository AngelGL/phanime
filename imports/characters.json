When born, a powerful nine-tailed demon fox attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains.

Also known as Yuki (\u30e6\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc, Yukk\u012b), he is a 14 year old middle schooler who is a rather quiet boy with an anti-social behavior who doesn't talk much. He mostly sees things around him as a bystander and writes it down in his cell phone diary. Yuki becomes involved in the Diary Game when to his shock that Deus, a god-like being whom he thought was an imaginary friend turns out to be real, selects him as one of twelve contestants in a 90 day battle royale where they must kill each other using their special diaries where the last survivor becomes Deus' new heir. Yuki's diary is called the Random Diary, which written from his point of view, gives a detailed explanation of his surroundings very accurately whether it be the present or the future. While versatile in any situation, the main disadvantage of the Random Diary is that it doesn't tells him what is happening to himself which leaves him vulnerable. Furthermore, since the diary is written from his point of view, Yuki can be tricked into thinking something he sees is true without realizing it which is a disadvantage for other people who use the Random Diary.\n\nUnlike most of the contestants, Yuki doesn't want any part of the game as he just wants to live peacefully and doesn't want to kill anyone, but is forced to play to survive and will only kill as a last resort as he is the main target by the other diary users because Deus sees Yuki as his favorite to win. Because he is weak, in order to protect himself, he quickly makes friends and allies to help him including Yuno Gasai, a girl in his class who is madly in love with him and is another diary user. Yuki is kind person yet is naive for quickly trusting people whether they be friend or other diary users as they may have ulterior motives. The most complex relationship he has is Yuno, while Yuno is a formidable ally, her mad obsessive love for him to the point she is willing to kill or use anyone so both of them can survive scares him yet despite the many things she does that shocks him including kidnapping him against his will and learning she killed her parents, Yuki still relies on Yuno in order to protect himself.\n "},{"id":4,"coverImage":"155093.jpg","firstName":"Yuno","lastName":"Gasai ","japaneseName":"\u6211\u59bb \u7531\u4e43","alternateName":"Second","gender":"Female","biography":"Birthday:16 november (Scorpio)\nOccupation: Middle School Student\n Likes: Yukiteru\nHeight: 159 cm\nWeight: 49 kg\n\nYuno Gasai is obsessively in love with Yukiteru (Yandere) as one can safely guess from just the simple name of her future diary.

After meeting the Kira investigation team, he requests that the task force refer to him as Ryuzaki for discretion. The Kira investigation team never learns his true name. Ohba said that L is the smartest character in the manga because \"the plot requires it.\" Ohba also said that he personally views L as \"slightly evil\"; for instance, in chapter 109, Near discloses the fact that L claimed to pursue cases out of personal interest with no great sense of justice.\n\nWhen asked about L's nationality, Ohba responded saying \"I think of him as a quarter Japanese, a quarter English, a quarter Russian and... maybe a quarter French or Italian? Something like that.\"\n\nTom S. Peperium of IGN described L's voice in the English anime version as \"low monotone, while inspired by the original Japanese actor, sounds like a man deep in thought, a master detective on the hunt.\"\n\nOhba said that his favorite human character in the series was L as Ohba believed that L was the \"strongest\" character in the series \"besides Light.\" Obata chose L as his favorite due to \"appearance, personality, everything.\" Obata said that he could never have created L and that he enjoyed drawing L. Obata added that because of this, L is not \"real\" to him and therefore he likes that aspect of L. In response to the question \"Who was the most fun to draw?\" both Ohba and Obata answered \"L.\"\n\nL's disheveled and languid appearance masks his great powers of deduction and insight. He tends to second-guess everything he is presented with, and is extremely meticulous and analytical. He has several quirks such as preferring to crouch rather than sit, eating only sweet foods like desserts and fruits, and holding items very delicately.

Ohba said that a negative reaction originated from \"the difference in their attitudes\" and that people may have viewed Near as \"a cheat.\" Ohba added that Near's \"cheeky behavior,\" intended to \"reinforce his childishness,\" had been construed as \"annoying.\"\n\nIn the final chapter Near brings finger puppets to the Yellow Box Warehouse. Takeshi Obata, artist of Death Note, said that Near first bought the Kira finger puppet and drew on it with a magic marker. Obata then said that Near must have created the other puppets afterwards.

In a special feature included in the series' fifth DVD, she and Lelouch discuss Washington's Rebellion, during which she speaks of participants such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin as if she had been close friends with both. In the past, she appears to have observed Suzaku and Lelouch when they were both children, having even interacted with Lelouch at one point, though he doesn't remember their meeting.\n[\/spoiler]\n\nHer individual experiences have led C.C. to become a detached and lonely individual, with little care for even those she has entered into contracts with, while in the past she was somewhat a spoiled and cheerful girl. She tells Lelouch that she has been alive so long that she can no longer remember who loves her and who hates her. Due to her nature and history, she has been lonely as long as she can remember. Lelouch replies, \"You're not alone. We are partners. If you are a witch, then I shall become a demon.\" Lelouch is possibly the first person that has ever truly cared for her and it appears that she reciprocates at least some of these feelings, as she unexpectedly kisses him after their memories are shared.\n\nC.C. has a strong penchant for pizza, especially Pizza Hut's (which sponsors the show in Japan, though the logo is blurred out in the English dub); she constantly orders pizzas to Lelouch's house using his credit card. She also carries around a stuffed toy of \"Cheese-kun\", the company's mascot in Japan. Her love of pizza is often used for comedic effect, as she was twice willing to risk capture simply to get a piece of a giant pizza being made by the Student Council (which is ruined both times); she doesn't trust Lelouch to retrieve it for her. Both Lelouch and Kallen sometimes refer to her as \"Pizza Girl.\"\n \n[spoiler]\nWhen left alone, she has sometimes spoken to a previously unknown person through means unknown, which, in episode 23, was revealed to be Marianne, Lelouch's deceased mother, although in episode 19 it appears that she is talking to V.V. as well. According to the DVD Magazine 02, she is talking to more than one person when she seems to be talking to herself. In the past, it was shown that she and Marianne were close.\n[\/spoiler]\n "},{"id":17,"coverImage":"31564.jpg","firstName":"Suzaku","lastName":"Kururugi","japaneseName":"\u67a2\u6728\u30b9\u30b6\u30af","alternateName":"White Knight, Knight of Seven, Spinzaku, Knight of Zero Read ","gender":"Male","biography":"Age: 17 (first season), 18 (second season)\nDate of Birth: July 10, 2000 a.t.b.\nZodiac Sign: Cancer\nBlood Type: O\nHeight: 176cm (5'9\")\nNationality: Japanese\nKnown Relatives: Genbu Kururugi (father, deceased), Kaguya Sumeragi (cousin)\nKnightmare Frame: Lancelot and Lancelot Albion\n \nLelouch's childhood friend and son of Japan's last prime minister.

A brilliant thinker who is quite talented at chess, he lives with his younger sister, Nunnally, with their maid, Sayoko Shinozaki, at a house situated within the compounds of Ashford Academy, where they are looked after by the Ashford family.\n\nLelouch is soon swept into the conflict between the Britannia Empire and the pockets of resistance which oppose it when he accidentally boards a truck being used by Japanese resistance operatives. Within the truck is a capsule holding C.C., who sacrifices herself to save him from the military forces trying to recapture her. When it seems as if her sacrifice was pointless, C.C. suddenly touches his hand and offers him the \"Power of the King,\" the mythical power of Geass. The Geass manifests itself in him as the power of absolute obedience, which allows him to make people obey his orders without question. \n\nWith his new power, Lelouch begins his rebellion against the Empire, forming the Order of the Black Knights and takes up the identity of Zero to lead them, becoming a revolutionary and gaining popular support amongst the people.\n \n[spoiler]\nLelouch is the son of the Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia, and the late Imperial Consort Marianne, making Lelouch the eleventh prince of the Britannian Imperial Family. He was seventeenth in line for the throne prior to his mother's assassination and his sister's crippling in the same incident. A ten year old Lelouch confronted the Emperor afterward and accused him of leaving his mother defenseless, even going as far as renouncing his entitlement to the throne. In response, his father banished him to Japan, where he was used as a political hostage in the Sakuradite conflict.\n\nIt was during his stay at the Kururugi household that he first met Suzaku Kururugi, with whom the young Lelouch did not interact initially in a friendly manner, before later becoming friends. However, when Britannia finally developed its Knightmare Frames fleet and decided to invade Japan to seize control of the Sakuradite mines, consequently discarding Lelouch's use as a diplomatic tool, Lelouch, fearing for his and his sister's safety, hid their true identities and sought the help of the Ashford family, who were his mother's allies.\n\nHis mother's death and his father's apparent lack of concern in regards to it were huge blows to Lelouch. He always felt that it was unfair for both his mother and sister, and therefore made it his goal to pursue a better world for Nunnally. He also seeks to discover the true reason for his mother's death, as she was murdered in the Aries Imperial Palace, a place terrorists would be unlikely to penetrate successfully without being noticed, if at all.\n\nShortly after gaining the power of Geass from C.C., Lelouch assumes the secret identity Zero, a mysterious, masked revolutionary dressed in a black helmet and cloak. The helmet has a retractable plate over the left eye so Lelouch can use his Geass. In this guise, he forms the Order of the Black Knights, initially composed of the members of Kallen K\u014dzuki's resistance group. The goal of this vigilante group is a campaign against powerful individuals who oppress the helpless, which he eventually expands into reforming Japan as an independent nation.\n\nLelouch is willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish his goal, even if it means lying to his followers and using people as bait for the outcome he desires. However, he has trouble putting those he is close to in harms way for the sake of his goal, which is a weakness as a commander but a remnant of his humanity and sanity. His feelings for Nunnally in particular often hinders his plans, particularly at the end of the first season, where he abandons a massive war with Britannian forces to rescue her. Gradually, however, he has come to embrace the fact that he has to destroy before reconstruction can occur, even if it means harming those he cares about.\n\nOriginally, Lelouch is motivated by the desire to avenge his mother's death and construct an ideal world where his sister Nunnally can live in peace. After Nunnally becomes Viceroy of Area 11, and her wishes conflict with his goals, his friends help him to realize that his rebellion is no longer just for Nunnally, but for all the people of the world. Following Nunnally's death and the betrayal of the Black Knights, Lelouch focuses on making sure that he at least takes the Emperor down with him.\n\nThe turning point in his rebellion comes when Euphemia li Britannia declares the region under Mount Fuji the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, giving the Japanese people their name and country back, albeit in a much smaller area. This effectively destroys any possibility of the Black Knights' rebellion; acceptance would render them powerless and refusal would make them pariahs. Lelouch confronts her at the opening ceremony and tries to have her shoot him, hoping to make himself a martyr. When she says she plans to give up her title, he surrenders and agrees to work with her. However, at this moment his Geass permanently activates, and an offhand comment about ordering her to kill the Japanese forces her to do just that. Lelouch reluctantly kills her and uses the massacre as an excuse to declare Japan an independent nation. He then leads an attack on the Tokyo Settlement. The attack goes well at first, but when Lelouch learns that Nunnally has been kidnapped, he abandons the battle, leaving his forces helpless against the much better organized Britannian forces.\n\nLelouch and C.C. make their way to Kaminejima to search for Nunnally, where Lelouch is confronted by Suzaku Kururugi. Lelouch attempts to broker a truce, but Suzaku is distraught over the death of Euphemia and refuses to listen. An angered Lelouch draws his pistol and both Lelouch and Suzaku attempt to shoot one another. A single gunshot is heard as the screen fades to black at the end of the first season.\n[\/spoiler]\n\nSeason Two\n[spoiler]\nOne year later, Lelouch is living a peaceful life with his younger brother, Rolo Lamperouge, and has no memory of his revolutionary activities, his Geass, Nunnally, his mother, or his royal lineage. Flashbacks reveal that neither Suzaku or Lelouch managed to kill one another. Instead, Lelouch was apprehended and brought before the Emperor, who used his own Geass to wipe Lelouch's memories and suppress his power.\n\nLelouch's memories and Geass are restored by C.C., and he resumes leadership of the Black Knights. To prevent retaliation by the Britannian forces, he makes his base in the Chinese Federation's consulate. When Nunnally is appointed as Viceroy of Area 11, and announces her plans to reestablish the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, Lelouch falls into depression since he would be impeding her wishes by continuing his rebellion. He nearly begins taking Refrain before Kallen stops him. With the help of Kallen and his friends at the Ashford Academy, Lelouch realizes that his mission no longer revolves solely around Nunnally, but concerns the rest of his friends, and the Japanese people as well. To solve both concerns, Lelouch engineers the legal exile of the Black Knights by getting the Britannians to agree to exile Zero in exchange for bringing one million participants for Nunnally's new Japan. By having them all dress as Zero, he forces Suzaku to exile them all rather than order a massacre. Sayoko stays behind as his body double to keep up the illusion that Lelouch and Zero are separate people, though during her short tenure as his impersonator she changes his image into that of an athletic womanizer.\n\nThe Black Knights escape to the Chinese Federation, where Lelouch begins his plans to win more countries to his side, creating a alliance that can match the Britannian Empire. He starts by overthrowing the High Eunuchs of the Chinese Federation and returning control to Empress Tianzi. He also has a secondary motive in doing so: the Chinese Federation is where V.V.'s Geass Directorate is headquartered. By taking control of the directorate, Lelouch believes he will be able to match the Emperor in both military and Geass might. While the remaining dissident forces are cleaned up, Lelouch returns to Japan to prepare for the invasion by installing Gefjun Disturbers in the mass transit rail system. The combined effect of every train running a Disturber would shut down Tokyo Settlement completely.\n\nAfter Shirley is killed by Rolo, Lelouch abandons his plan to take over the Geass Directorate, instead mounting an all-out assault on their stronghold. He orders the deaths of everyone within, resulting in the death of General Bartley among countless others. V.V. tries to use the Siegfried to buy time for the remaining members to escape, but it is destroyed with the aid of Cornelia while C.C. annihilates the remaining followers. Lelouch chases V.V. back into the temple, where he is unexpectedly teleported to the Sword of Akasha to face the Emperor. Lelouch attempts to kill the Emperor, but he has become immortal like C.C. The Emperor tells Lelouch about the world's lies, and shortly after C.C. arrives, finally revealing the contents of their pact. She would have had Lelouch kill her and take on her immortality, but instead spares him by placing him inside her memories while the Emperor kills her. Lelouch refuses to let her die unhappy and convinces her to live on. Lelouch destroys part of the Sword of Akasha and is transported back to the real world with C.C., but her memories of her life after gaining Geass have been erased.\n\nLelouch then completes ratifying the United Federation of Nations, and their first act is to liberate Japan. To insure Nunnally's safety, Lelouch agrees to meet Suzaku alone at the Kururugi Shrine. Suzaku demands answers about Lelouch's various uses of Geass, but Lelouch lies, claiming that everything he has ever done was purely for selfish reasons. Suzaku realizes that Lelouch is lying and agrees to help, but Prince Schneizel's troops move in to arrest Lelouch, convincing him that Suzaku sold him out. Lelouch escapes with the help of Guilford, having used his Geass to make Guilford see him as Princess Cornelia, and uses the Gefjun Disturber trains to shut down Tokyo Settlement. He resolves to abandon his emotions in order to achieve his goals, having lost his faith in friendship.\n\nIn the second battle of Tokyo, Lelouch directs his forces to focus on the government building in an effort to secure Nunnally. Suzaku threatens to use the F.L.E.I.J.A. bomb unless Lelouch stands down, but Lelouch merely waves him off as a liar. Once Kallen escapes in her upgraded Guren and Suzaku becomes an obstacle, Lelouch orders her to kill him. As her Knightmare is far more advanced, she nearly succeeds. Suzaku's imminent defeat activates his Geass command, causing him to launch F.L.E.I.J.A. The bomb engulfs the government complex, killing Nunnally among countless others. Lelouch goes into a nervous breakdown at the thought, refusing to believe that Nunnally could be dead. His identity is then exposed by Schneizel and the Black Knights betray him. Rolo evacuates him, but dies in the attempt. In the end, Lelouch comes to terms with his feelings for Rolo. Having lost everything as retribution for his acts, he realizes that the last thing he must do is drag his father into hell with him.\n\nWith his renewed purpose, Lelouch quickly sets off to defeat the Emperor, throwing the Britannian ranks into chaos by using his Geass to make numerous soldiers slaves to his will. As the Britannian forces battle one another, Lelouch confronts the Emperor in the Sword of Akasha, sealing the entrance behind him so they will both be trapped for eternity.\n[\/spoiler]\n\nGeass:\nLelouch's Geass, given to him by C.C., grants him \"the power of absolute obedience,\" allowing him to plant commands within a person's mind upon eye contact which they will obey without question. Activation of his Geass is visually represented by the manifestation of a Geass sigil in his left eye. Commands dictated in this state are written into the minds of the designated targets once the sigil projects from his eye to theirs. Lelouch could initially toggle Geass activation at will, but subsequently loses this control to an affliction known as Geass runaway.\n \n[spoiler]\nIn the second season, C.C. gives Lelouch a contact lens that blocks his Geass, but indicates that his Geass will eventually grow powerful enough to render it ineffective.\n[\/spoiler]\n\nOf all the Geass abilities in the series, Lelouch's has been explored the most, and also seems to have the most restrictions and side effects of any Geass introduced.\n\n* Commands must be issued verbally.\n* The victim must make direct eye contact for commands to be issued. The maximum effective distance is 270 meters. Line of sight via a reflective surface is sufficient for the effect to occur.\n* Commands may be issued only once to any given individual, but any number of commands may be issued at initial application so long as eye contact is unbroken. Since Jeremiah's Geass Canceller negates all Geass effects, those exposed to it may be commanded once again.\n* The victim will not perform any action disallowed by their physical or mental capabilities, though they will try to carry out the command to the best of their ability. For example, a victim will not be able to correctly answer a question they don't know the answer to, but will direct the user to someone who can if they are able. However, commands that affect the mind or consciousness, such as telling the victim to forget something, will take effect despite the fact that the victim could not normally force themselves to do so.\n* An action will be carried out for as long as dictated in its command, or upon the indicated conditional circumstance. Eye contact does not need to be maintained for command execution to occur. No upper limit has been established, but the conditional command Lelouch gives Suzaku is still in effect more than a year later.\n* The victim's memories for the duration of command issue and execution are sealed and cannot be recalled.\n* A victim may resist a commanded action to some degree if it is utterly repugnant to them.\n\nSo long as the above conditions are met, commands may be issued to anybody besides those who have gained the power of immortality and to any number of individuals at once. Those under the effect of Geass have a red outline on their pupils, presumably a visual cue for the viewer since the characters never point it out.\n\nEven without his Geass, Lelouch is a formidable opponent. He is highly intelligent, possessing a genius-level intellect, and is capable of devising and executing strategies with incredible speed and precision. Rolo notes that operating the Absolute Defense Territory of the Shinkir\u014d requires complex calculations which he cannot perform, while Lelouch almost makes it look easy. In the audio dramas, Suzaku says that, when they were children, Lelouch devised a secret sign language containing over 500 words.\n\nLelouch is quick to deduce facts from simple clues. In episode 14, when Mao says C.C.'s name, Lelouch instantly comes up with fourteen different possibilities for Mao's identity, including the correct one. Lelouch is also able to predict the Lancelot's actions exactly through his study of their past battles, allowing Kallen and the Four Holy Swords to almost defeat it (only Suzaku's reflexes saved his life).\n\nLelouch is also charismatic and persuasive; as Zero, he is able to win the support of much of Japan's population through well-delivered speeches combined with his ability to make miracles in almost any situation through his superior tactical planning. Mao repeatedly praises Lelouch's persuasive talent, and V.V. remarks that Lelouch is \"a lot like his father.\"\n\nPhysically, Lelouch is underwhelming. He possesses the physical prowess of a teenager who engages in little to no strenuous physical activity. Thus, one of Lelouch's traits is the inability to run very fast or for any substantial period of time. Within the series, this is usually played for comedic effect, as Lelouch is constantly outpaced by his classmates in every situation, and even the most simple tasks requiring manual labor exhaust him before he manages to accomplish anything significant. This joke is taken to its logical conclusion in the second season, where it is revealed that Lelouch is supposed to attend remedial physical education classes, but skips them as often as possible. This creates problems when Sayoko poses as Lelouch: she is a master of martial arts, and hence far more athletic than Lelouch himself. Lelouch laments the problem and decides to have Sayoko attend his gym classes to fix it.\n\nLelouch is also shown to be very talented at most domestic skills, including cooking and sewing; it has been stated that this comes as a result of his taking care of himself and Nunnally for seven years. He has been shown to be an excellent cook, and is usually the one cooking the food for parties held by the Student Council, both because the others (except Milly) are terrible cooks and nobody else can meet his exacting requirements (such as measuring ingredients to three significant decimals).\n\nLelouch also has some skill with firearms, usually brandishing a Britannian pistol when threatening someone. His Knightmare piloting skill has been shown to be proficient but not exceptional; he is a capable pilot by himself, though he tends to be overwhelmed by Suzaku and other pilots with more advanced Knightmares at their disposal. When Lelouch pilots a standard Knightmare on the battlefield, he is typically accompanied by Kallen, who is an elite Knightmare pilot and the leader of his personal squad, Squad Zero. \n \n[spoiler]\nAfter stealing the Gawain, Lelouch co-pilots it with C.C., controlling the weapons and command functions while C.C. handles navigation and flight. After the Black Knights are exiled from Japan, Lelouch pilots the Shinkir\u014d, which has the most powerful defense of any Knightmare.\n[\/spoiler]\n[spoiler]\nAt the end of season 2, Lelouch ordered Suzaku to kill him so that his sins and all the people's hatred will disappear and he will be free. Killing him will be a key to future happiness. After Lelouch died, Nunnally realized that without her brother she cannot live even though she was away from him for a very long time.\n[\/spoiler]"},{"id":19,"coverImage":"31533.jpg","firstName":"Kallen","lastName":"Stadtfeld","japaneseName":"\u30ab\u30ec\u30f3\u30fb\u30b7\u30e5\u30bf\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb\u30c8, \u7d05\u6708\u30ab\u30ec\u30f3","alternateName":"Red Lotus, Karen Kouzuki, Q1","gender":"Female","biography":"Age: 17 (season 1) 18 (season 2)\nZodiac Sign: Aries\nBlood Type: B\nHeight: 173 cm (5'8\")\nBirth date: March 29, 2000\n\nA Britannian-Eleven girl, who believes herself to be a Japanese person at heart.

However, her personality changes in to a very strong-willed and forceful one when she acts as a resistance fighter.\n\nAs a running gag, Kallen ends up nude or immodestly dressed in front of other people on numerous occasions: Lelouch sees her naked after she pulls back a shower curtain in surprise in the third episode, Suzaku sees her bathing under a waterfall when they are stranded on Kaminejima, she is forced to dress in an immodest bunny costume at the start of the second season (to plant a tracking device on Lelouch), and she walks in on a meeting between C.C. and the Chinese ambassadors wearing only a towel when intending to complain about the previous situation to C.C. (claiming that the operation would've gone faster if C.C. was wearing the outfit).\n\nIn an interview reported by the anime magazine Newtype USA, seiyu Ami Koshimizu talked about the difficulty of voicing Kallen because of the double life that her character leads.

She has extensive experience in medical cybernetics, and appears to have been an academy acquaintance of Lloyd Asplund and C\u00e9cile Croomy. Rakshata is not fond of speaking of the past, but it is known that she studied at the Imperial Colchester Institute. She is fairly laid back in most situations, usually seeing laying on a couch when not actively working (one is even installed on the bridge of the Black Knights' flagship, the Ikaruga), and is never seen without her tobacco pipe. She affectionately refers to her technological creations as her \"children\" and treats them as such. She is visibly enraged, a contrast to her normal demeanor, upon learning that Lloyd and C\u00e9cile modified her Knightmare without her consent (they are kind enough to credit her for the design, though). Upon the formation of the UFN and the reorganization of the Black Knights as its military force, Rakshata is designated as the Chief of Science, similar to her previous position within the Black Knights.Rakshata is the creator of the Guren Mk-II and its radiant wave surger weapon. She also developed the Gefjun Disturber, a force field generator that disables all sakuradite-powered technology within its area of effect. This includes Knightmares, though by the second season newer models have countermeasures added to negate the Disturber's effect; only fifth-generation or older Knightmares remain vulnerable. In addition, the field blocks the motion of hadrons, radio waves, and microwaves. This renders anything within the field invisible to radar, and can aid in the blooming of hadron-based beam weaponry. It is named after the Norse goddess of chastity Gefjun.
