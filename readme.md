## phanime [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MaazAli/phanime.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/MaazAli/phanime/)

Phanime is built using [Meteor](http://meteor.com) a full stack JavaScript framework. Meteor has a nice packaging system that can be used to implement new features in a modular way. Although Phanime doesn't currently take full advantage of Meteor's packaging system, it will use it for future development.
